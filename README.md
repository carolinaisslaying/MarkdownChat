# MarkdownChat  
This is a simplistic and lightweight plugin that allows you to use Markdown in your server's Minecraft chat. It implements Phoenix616's [MineDown library](https://github.com/Phoenix616/MineDown). 

This plugin has been made with compatibility of 1.20.x Paper and Folia in mind. Due to its simplistic nature, it may not function correctly with other chat plugins. Please [report these issues](https://github.com/carolinaisslaying/MarkdownChat/issues) to me and I will look into fixing them.

The the full syntax provided by the MineDown library is available [here](https://wiki.phoenix616.dev/library/minedown/syntax). Simply use the syntax in a regular global chat message, and voila!

This plugin defaults to allowing all users to use markdown chat formatting, however, it has a permission node `markdownchat.use` if you wish to limit who can utilise the chat formatting.
